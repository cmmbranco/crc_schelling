Project #2
Schellingâ€™s Segregation Model

There should be four files, README.txt, Pipfile, schelling.py, report.pdf.

There are two things needed to run the simulation: Python 3 (tested on 3.6), and pipenv installed.

To install pipenv run: pip install pipenv

To install the dependencies of the project: pipenv install
This will install all the dependencies needed to run the source code.

To enter the new virtual environment: pipenv shell

To run the source code it's just: ./schelling.py

To change parameters you can do so by passing arguments in the console.
Do './schelling.py -h' to see what arguments to pass, most are intuitive, two may not be so, they are explained
with some more detail in the report, right at the top of the Results section.
